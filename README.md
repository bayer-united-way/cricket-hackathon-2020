## Contributions: 

All code and data used during the hackathon will be maintained as per open-source standards.  Therefore, it is important to understand the open source policies and follow these practices: 

Create a repo on GitHub.com that will be made public at the end of the hackathon 

Use only acceptable open source libraries 

Do NOT copy or use proprietary/company specific source code, libraries, or data unless they have already been open-sourced 

Ensure the repo is cleansed of any company-specific information or secrets that could be accidentally exposed 

Your solution should be production ready with the best user experience for the organizers to host it on the United Way AWS infrastructure. 

Organizers will work with the winning teams to deploy and launch the solutions after the event.
